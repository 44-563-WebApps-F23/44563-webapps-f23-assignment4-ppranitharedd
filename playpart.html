        HILDA.[Stares fixedly upwards and says, as if petrified.] My Master Builder.
        
        RAGNAR.[Supports himself, trembling, against the railing.] He must be dashed to
        pieces--killed on the spot.
        
        ONE OF THE LADIES.[Whilst MRS. SOLNESS is carried into the house.] Run down for the
        doctor--
        
        RAGNAR.I can't stir a root--

        ANOTHER LADY.Then call to some one!
        
        RAGNAR.[Tries to call out.] How is it? Is he alive?
        
        A VOICE.[Below, in the garden.] Mr. Solness is dead!
        
        OTHER VOICES.[Nearer.] The head is all crushed.--he fell right into the quarry.
    
        HILDA.[Turns to RAGNAR, and says quietly.] I can't see him up there now.

        RAGNAR.
        This is terrible. So, after all, he could not do it.
        HILDA.[As if in quiet spell-bound triumph.] But he mounted right to the top.
        And I heard harps in the air. [Waves her shawl in the air, and shrieks
        with wild intensity.] My--my Master Builder!</p>
