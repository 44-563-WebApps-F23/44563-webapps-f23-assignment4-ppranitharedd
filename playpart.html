        [Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
        laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
        much longer!        
        KAIA.        
        [Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
        Uncle?
        BROVIK.
        Oh, I seem to get worse every day.
        RAGNAR.
        [Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
        little sleep--
        BROVIK.
        [Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?
        KAIA.

        RAGNAR.
        Yes, do. I will come with you.
        BROVIK.
        [With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
        it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with
        him--with the chief.
